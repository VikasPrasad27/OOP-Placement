/*
Question #8: 
Airport security officials have confiscated several item of the passengers at the security check 
point. All the items have been dumped into a huge box (array). Each item possesses a certain 
amount of risk[0,1,2]. Here, the risk severity of the items represent an array[] of N number of 
integer values. The task here is to sort the items based on their levels of risk in the array. The risk 
values range from 0 to 2. 
Example : 
Input : 
7  -> Value of N 
[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line. 
Output : 
0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity
